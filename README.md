# Choose your own adventure (in PHP)

This is a little script I put together in 2001(!) to create a DIY choose-your-own-adventure story.
For a while it got popular and trhe story got a little crazy. You can view the original installtion
here:

Some clever folks <a href="https://github.com/teamcoltra/Choose-Your-Own-Adventure/">created a fork on github</a>,
including the db connection guts and an installer script. If you actually want to use it, their version is
a much better place to start.
